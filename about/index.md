My name is Samantha Marie Lewis. I was born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina. I have also lived in Rexburg, Idaho and Denton, Texas. I graduated from the University of North Carolina Wilmington with a BA in English in 2016. My concentration was in literature and I studied a lot of feminist theory. I graduated from UNCW once again in 2019 with a Masters of Teaching in Secondary Education. During my educational years, I mainly spent my time as a teacher assistant to Honors and AP English seniors. I enjoyed teaching Shakespeare and working with students on their college essays and plans. 

I am currently enrolled in the University of North Carolina Greensboro in the Masters of Library and Information Science program. I am currently set to graduate in the Spring 2021 semester; I will have completed my MLIS in less than 2 years if I stay on track. My main interests are User Experience and Assessment, Social Media and Youth/Young Adult Services. I would like to pursue a career in young adult literature collection management, youth programming or social media coordination. I plan to start looking for careers as soon as possible. 

My favorite hobbies are writing, reading, playing video and tabletop games and looking at paintings of forest and nature scenary and cute dogs on the internet. I would love to encorporate my interests into youth library programming as well as a library's social media presence. I currently live in Wilmington, NC with my husband Taylor and my one-year-old maltese Genji.
